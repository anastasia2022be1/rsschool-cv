### About myself:
I believe that  front-end development satisfies my need for creativity. It enable me to easily put my ideas into digital form and get results back really quick. I still remember the first time I created an HTML page 'Hello World' and opened it in the browser. A whole new world of possibilities appeared before my eyes.

I became really passionate and keep creating since then. I’m really grateful that I’m able to  made my passion my work.

### Code example:
_Write a function makeArray(firstArray, secondArray, maxLength) to create a new array with all the elements of the two original firstArray and secondArray. The maxLength parameter contains the maximum allowed length of the new array.
If the number of elements of the new array is greater than maxLength, the function must return a copy of the array with the length of maxLength elements. Otherwise, the function must return the entire new array._

```
function makeArray(firstArray, secondArray, maxLength) {
  let joinArray = firstArray.concat(secondArray);
  let newArray  =[];
  if (joinArray.length > maxLength) {
    newArray = joinArray.slice(0, maxLength);
  } else {
    newArray = joinArray;
  }
  return newArray;
  }
